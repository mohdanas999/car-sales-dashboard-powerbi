Car Sales Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

Project Overview:

This project is an interactive Car Sales Performance Dashboard built in Power BI to analyze sales across time, company, body style, color, dealer region, and customer-level transactions.

The dashboard enables business stakeholders to monitor key performance indicators, identify revenue drivers, evaluate pricing behavior, and compare regional performance to support data-driven decision-making.

The solution contains two views-

Overview Dashboard – High-level KPIs and sales trends

Details Dashboard – Transaction-level drill-down and record-level exploration

Business Objective:

Transform raw car sales data into actionable insights that answer:

How much are we selling (YTD / MTD)?

Which brands, body styles, and regions drive revenue?

How are price and volume trending over time?

Where should management focus to improve performance?

Process:

Validated and cleaned raw data for missing values, inconsistencies, and formatting issues

Standardized fields and ensured correct data types

Built dynamic DAX measures (YTD Sales, MTD Sales, Avg Price, Cars Sold, Growth %)

Designed story-driven visuals using KPI cards, trend charts, breakdown charts, and slicers

Implemented drill-down and interactive filtering for deeper analysis

Key Insights:

YTD sales increased by $70.8M (+23.59%) with a volume growth of +2.6K units (+24.57%)

Average selling price remains stable, indicating consistent pricing strategy

A small set of brands contributes a large share of total revenue

SUVs and Sedans are the highest-selling body styles

Pale White and Black are the most preferred colors

Certain dealer regions consistently outperform others

Problems Solved:
